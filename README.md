Mental Health Awareness Website

● Live Site link

● Introduction

The project owner supplied me with the following brief:
- We want to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design.
- The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.
The customer spoke about what the user is looking to get out of the website, here are a few examples we discussed, with more info found in the user stories section:
- The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health.
- Including how to recognize common issues and manage stress.
- The information needs to be presented in a supportive and organised layout that is easily accessible.
