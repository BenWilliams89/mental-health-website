Mental Health Awareness Website

● Live Site link
● Introduction:
Mental Clarity is a fictional company dedicated to help support people who are struggling with their mental health.
This is my first project/website build after learning HTML, CSS and Bootstrap over the past 4 weeks and combining all of my recent skills together in a short space of time.


● Key Objectives:

The project owner supplied me with the following brief:
- We want to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design.
- The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.
The customer spoke about what the user is looking to get out of the website, here are a few examples we discussed, with more info found in the user stories section:
- The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health.
- Including how to recognize common issues and manage stress.
- The information needs to be presented in a supportive and organised layout that is easily accessible.

● User Stories - These can be found in my GitHub in more detail:
  - As a user, I want visual aids such as images or icons to enhance the understanding of content.
  - As a user, I want an easy-to-navigate layout so that I can quickly find the information I need.
  - As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can access it easily on any device.
  - As a user, I want to see positive affirmations so that I feel uplifted and encouraged.
  - As a user, I want resource links to external mental health support so that I can find additional help.
  - As a user, I want tips on managing stress so that I can apply them to my daily life.
  - As a user, I want accessible information on common mental health issues so that I can recognize and understand them.
  - As a user, I want to see a welcoming hero section so that I feel encouraged and supported.

Steps:

- Added HTML boilerplate

- Added all the links in the header, like bootstrap, css and favion. Also added them to the bottom of the body while placing my css link after my bootstrap link encase i needed to overrule any changes bootstrap was applying.

- Added a readme and added basic outline steps

- Addedd a css file and changed background colour to check it was working, then added google fonts

- Added a navbar with bootstrap and made some changes by removing and updating certain fields to give it the style i wanted such as deleting disabled button and search bar.

- used co-pilot to come up with a favicon image, then went to favicon.io to reduce the size and get the code to add to the html

- Nav bar background was changed by inspecting the browser with the navtools - finding that the navbar class had an !important in it that was overriding my colours. found the issues then removed in code to update the navbar colour.

- Next I created the Hero section by creating a container, then a row and then two divs. The first div had some text, paragraghs , icons and a button. The second div had an img. I made these align center and tweaked the styling to have a correct looking layout.

- I used font-awesome for the icons 

- I worked on my next section of services and used the cards element in bootstrap, here I displayed the 3 ways the business is able to offer support.

- I got images from pexels
