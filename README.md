● Introduction:
Mental Clarity is a fictional company dedicated to help support people who are struggling with their mental health.
This is my first project/website build after learning HTML, CSS and Bootstrap over the past 4 weeks and combining all of my recent skills together in a short space of time.



● Key Objectives:

The project owner supplied me with the following brief:
- We want to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design.
- The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.
The customer spoke about what the user is looking to get out of the website, here are a few examples we discussed, with more info found in the user stories section:
- The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health.
- Including how to recognize common issues and manage stress.
- The information needs to be presented in a supportive and organised layout that is easily accessible.



● User Stories - These can be found in my GitHub in more detail:
  - As a user, I want visual aids such as images or icons to enhance the understanding of content.
  - As a user, I want an easy-to-navigate layout so that I can quickly find the information I need.
  - As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can access it easily on any device.
  - As a user, I want to see positive affirmations so that I feel uplifted and encouraged.
  - As a user, I want resource links to external mental health support so that I can find additional help.
  - As a user, I want tips on managing stress so that I can apply them to my daily life.
  - As a user, I want accessible information on common mental health issues so that I can recognize and understand them.
  - As a user, I want to see a welcoming hero section so that I feel encouraged and supported.
